## Introduction

Quantum computing is an exciting and rapidly evolving field, and pytket aims to simplify the development of quantum software. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced quantum programmer, pytket can be a valuable tool in your quantum computing journey.

## Installation

To get started with pytket, you'll need to install it. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pytket
```

For more installation options and details, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/quantinuum/pytket#installation).

## Usage

Once you have pytket installed, you can start using it in your projects. Here's a simple example of creating a quantum circuit:

```python
from pytket import Circuit

# Create a quantum circuit
circuit = Circuit(2)

# Add gates to the circuit
circuit.H(0)
circuit.CX(0, 1)

print(circuit)

```
