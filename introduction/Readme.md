## Keys to a quality quantum computer

**DiVincenzo Criteria**

1. A scalable physical system with well characterized qubits
2. The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple standard or baseline state.
3. Long Relative Coherence times
4. A universal set of quantum gates
5. A qubit-specific measurement capability.



## Quantum Charge-Coupled Device Architecture (proposed in 1998)

### Key Features
<li> Qubits through ions
<li> Connectivity by physical transport
<li> High-fidelity gates via lasers on short ion chains
<li> Dedicated zones for logic/initialization/measure
<li> Scalability enabled by microfabricated traps.
